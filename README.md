# bikes-for-refugees
Exercise for HTML & CSS - lesson 1

### Set up

**Fork** this repository to your personal Github account (look for the 'fork' button on this page).

Then, **clone** it to your machine, using the following terminal commands.

>Go to the folder you wish to save the project in:
`cd <your-project-directory>`

>Clone the repo:
`git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/bikes-for-refugees.git`

>>>>>>>>>>problem here
Now, **create a new branch** with your name in the title
>`git checkout -b bikes-for-refugees/yourname`

You're now ready to code!

### Exercise

The aim of the exercise is for your webpage to look like this: 
https://codeyourfuture.github.io/syllabus-london/html-css/assets/screenshot-complete.png

Open the `index.html` file in your browser, and compare it to the image of the final result. What's different?

#### Use semantic markup

Where necessary, replace the `<div>`s with semantic HTML tags. This will not render differently in the browser, but it's good practice to use semantic markup when you can!

#### Fix the broken images

Some of the links to images are broken. The images you need are in the `images` folder - please replace any broken image links with the correct paths.

#### Style buttons

There are 3 buttons on the page. They need to be styled correctly - remember, re-use styles as much as possible by using classes.

#### Fix the positioning

Use Flexbox to move elements around so they are positioned correctly.
